# Weekly Subscription Retention Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes subscription churn through weekly retention cohorts. The PM identified that monthly retention data might miss critical early churn insights. The goal was to calculate weekly retention rates for user cohorts and monitor activity over 6 weeks to uncover patterns and inform strategic decisions.
